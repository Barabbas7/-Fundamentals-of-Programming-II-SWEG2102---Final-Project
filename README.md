## A platform that connects lounges and students in AASTU
This is a simple demonstration project that shows how to use C++ with database. We used SQLite database to store Orders and Food informations. Since we consider our university, most of the data in the database are local. Ofcourse you can change them to your preference
### To run this code
* You must configure your complier to include the sqlite3.h library.
  The process to link SQLite to your compiler might be different in different IDEs. you can search for one that goes with your preference and IDE
* You must also create a Databse folder on the root directory or you can change the directory variable in the code to one that suits you.
